                            Hopefully this is the last time I'll have to say it, but my name is Chris Andrade! You can see me there on the left. I'm currently a third year Software Engineering student
                            at McMaster University  in Hamilton, Ontario, Canada. As of right now (seriously, right now!) I'm looking for spring internships lasting 12-16 months, specifically as a web developer, hence
                            the creation of this website of course (it was also good fun). I am able to do full-stack, so backend, frontend, or both roles are all great to me. In my spare time, I also have some interest
                            in information security and video game development :).
                        </p>
                        <br>
                        <p>
                            I'm currently experimenting with the MERN web development stack, so that is my current go-to, but really, I'm still a student so I'm open to anything. I would not mind learning any other
                            stacks or any other languages. At this point, I've learned so many that I seem to know the concepts quite well, which make learning new things a much quicker process. If you want to see
                            all the things I've worked on (that I'm at least slightly proud to show), check out my GitHub. For the larger projects, scroll down!

                            This is the part where I'm not sure if people care about, but hopefully you do. So, let's talk about my hobbies. In relation to my career, like I said I enjoy web development, game development,
                            and security, even databasing and networks. I just can't get enough of the whole tree of software. With hobbies, I'm a learning guitar player and really love making music. I'm still a novice,
                            but am currently reading some books to get better at composition. I also love writing both fiction (like blogs) and non-fiction (like sci-fi) in my spare time. Speaking of sci-fi, I also like, well,
                            sci-non-fi? Ok, astronomy. I love astronomy. Lastly, I'm a big soccer fan (if you're a European I apologize, I meant football, I promise).
